High-level description:
An app that will help people stay ahead of gift-giving obligations (Birthdays, Christmas, anniversaries etc).
The app will allow users to keep their Google Calendar up-to-date with reminders to buy gifts.
The app will allow users to:
- Track their annual budget for gifts.
- Track gift-giving events.
- Record ideas for gifts.
- Find gifts easily via search suggestions.
- Assign gifts to each event.
This information (including reminders) will then be added to their Google Calendar.

User stories.  As a user:
- I should be able to sign up and log in/out.
- I should be able to view (GET) the information I've entered in a list format and on a calendar.
- It should be easy to create (POST) recipients and gift lists.
- It should be easy to edit (PUT) entries (and obvious how).
- I should be able to remove (DELETE) entries.
- It should be clear to me what the app is for.
- It should be possible to add the information to my Google Calendar.
- I should be able to record my annual gift budget and see how much money I have remaining for each year.
- I should be presented with shopping search suggestions on Google Shopping or Amazon.
- I should be able to state whether a gift event (e.g. birthday, housewarming party) are annual or one-off.
- I should be reminded of gift dates (deadlines) in a timely manner.  (Default 30 days prior?)
- I should be allowed to adjust reminder dates if I want to.
