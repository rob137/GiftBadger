For your capstone, we'd like you to add a README.md file to your repo. At a minimum, this file should contain:

The name of your app at the top of the file
Documentation of your API.
Screenshot(s) of your app. This makes your app description much easier to understand. For this, you'll need to take a screenshot, add it to your repo, and use the Markdown formatting for images (as described in the Markdown docs)Assuming that you store your screenshot and README.md file are both in the root of your repo, your README.md might look something like this:
  # My great app
